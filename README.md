# cs.projecteuler
A respository for solutions to projecteuler.com problems.

Project Euler has a series of mathematical problems of increasing difficulty to solve. 

# Structure
The solution is broken into several projects:

Solutions: containing solutions to the ProjectEuler problems
ProjectEuler.Tests: which tests those solutions
Utility: for reusable functions/objects, eg computing primes

Testing
Unit tests
Tests for this solution are written using the built in Visual Studio testing library.
